# GraphQL Notes #

----------

Fields - maybe map to properties on objects

Variables - generic making query more usable

Directives - have three characteristics...unique name to identify them, list of arguments, and a
list of locations

Aliases - Data exposed by the server might have different property names that what the UI is using...the client has an extra layer of control over the response

Fragments - is just a partial operation; we can't use it on its own

Mutations - will have side effects on some elements of data
